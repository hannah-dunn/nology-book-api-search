### Outline

This project required the use of both DOM manipulation and Asynchronous programming. The user is able to search for a book inside the Google Books database via the search bar, return 12 results, and then are able to view details about each title.

### MVP

Create a page that allows users to search for books Page should include the following:

- Header section introducing the page
- Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
- A grid of books
- Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, etc.
